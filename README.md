# PLANT
Protein Language Model for Antigenic cartography

## Summary
Seasonal influenza viruses evade host immunity through rapid antigenic evolution. Antigenicity is assessed by serological assays and typically visualized as antigenic maps, which represent antigenic differences among virus strains. However, conventional maps cannot directly infer the antigenicity of unexamined strains from their genotypes. Here, we present PLANT, a protein language model that projects influenza A/H3N2 viruses onto an antigenic map using HA protein sequences.

## Trained model
The PLANT model, trained on data up to the 2024 Southern Hemisphere season (full model), is available on the Hugging Face repository: [TheSatoLab-UTokyo/PLANT](https://huggingface.co/TheSatoLab-UTokyo/PLANT)

Altough the original model used in the preprint, please use the fixed model with improved performance in **variants/PLANT_fixed**.

## Core component of PLANT
Please refer to **src/plant/model.py** if you are interested in the implementation of PLANT and its pLM-DMS.

## Google Colab notebook
A Colab notebook for embedding your sequences of interest onto the antigenic map constructed by the full model is available at the following link:
